                The bite from a radioactive spider granted Peter Parker amazing arachnid-like powers. After losing his
                beloved Uncle Ben to a burglar, grief- stricken Peter vowed to use his incredible abilities to protect
                his city as the Amazing Spider-Man. Peter’s trials taught him an invaluable lesson: with great power,
                there must also come great responsibility.

            <p>Former thief Scott Lang once stole an advanced size-altering suit in order to aid his ailing daughter,
                only to discover that the stolen tech belonged to the world-renowned Dr. Hank Pym. Seeing the heroic
                potential within him, Dr. Pym allowed Scott to continue using the suit, as well as the identity Pym once
                battled evil under. As the Astonishing Ant-Man, Scott now handles the jobs "too small" for any other
                Super Hero.</p>
